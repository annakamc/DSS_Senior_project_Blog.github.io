    "text": "Data cleaning is one of the most importantâ€”and often overlookedâ€”steps in any data workflow. In both industry and real life, clean data leads to clearer insights, better decisions, and stronger outcomes. Thanks for joining me on this journey into real-world examples and practical industry level tips!\n\nThis post dives into one of my biggest passionsâ€”regexâ€”and how it became a key part of one of my favorite projects: cleaning AWS Textract outputs from 2D PDF drawings. I was fortunate to be trusted with this project. By speaking and teaching about regex at advanced analytics meetings at work, Iâ€™ve carved out a niche where I get to use it daily. This project marks a turning point in my journey, and Iâ€™m excited to share what Iâ€™ve learned in a way thatâ€™s approachable, practical, and maybe even a little funâ€”for anyone curious about how powerful regex can be.\n\n\n\n Back to top"
